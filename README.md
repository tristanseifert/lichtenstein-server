# Lichtenstein Server
This is the C++ server that controls the networked Lichtenstein LED controllers. The server is controlled via a simple JSON API over a UNIX socket. Data is persisted to disk with a simple embedded sqlite3 database. All effects are enumerated and executed as needed, and updates sent to nodes as needed.
